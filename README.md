# My Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and professional experience.

The site is built with a modern technology stack, combining a static front-end with a high-performance back-end API for handling contact form submissions.

## Features

* **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and responsive user interface.
* **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between a light and dark theme for a better viewing experience.
* **Projects Showcase**: Dynamically displays project details in a modal pop-up.
* **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form powered by a FastAPI back-end that saves messages to a PostgreSQL database.
* **CI/CD**: An automated pipeline that runs tests and deploys the application on every push to the `main` branch.

## Technologies

### Front-End

### Back-End

* **Python**: The core language for the back-end.
* **FastAPI**: A high-performance web framework.
* **SQLAlchemy**: An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interaction.

### DevOps & Deployment
